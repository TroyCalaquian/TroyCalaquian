Hey there! My name is Troy Calaquian! I'm your typical coder who loves video games, anime, manga, and playing on my guitar! 
I'm not sure how much GitHub I'll use outside of CST at BCIT, but it'll likely become something that I'll use a lot in the future.

Also, please don't plagarize my work. Or else...
